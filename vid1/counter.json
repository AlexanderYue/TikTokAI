"While the Stanley Cup is known for its wild and entertaining traditions, it's worth considering if these antics truly honor the trophy's legacy. Using it as a drinking vessel, leaving it by the roadside, or turning it into a makeshift potty might be seen as disrespectful to the sport. Moreover, many around the world aren't even aware of the Stanley Cup's significance. Perhaps it's time to celebrate victories in ways that uphold the dignity of hockey and help elevate its global appreciation."
