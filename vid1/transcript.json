 A year ago, May I looked and I was averaging 20 people on this tour. And today we had five. Six. We had six. The travel industry is bracing for what is shaping up to be a really tough year. They're expecting to lose some 12 and a half billion, that's what the be. Billion dollars in revenue this year. What's the reason why we'll international travelers are what are the United States? And nowhere is that more apparent than right here in New York City, where they're expecting a 17% drop in international travelers this year. Right now the United States in some ways is a tough sell. What do you think it's going to take to bring back the overseas the international tourists? Well, change it right into tort tariffs. This climate guides like Renee Wiske, who leads historical walk-in tours, are now worried about their future. I'm not sure what we can do. I'm not sure how to change the attitudes, but just now people are losing their jobs in New York City. What would you say the outlook is? I'm not sure in June I have one tour so far. I'm used to working three days a week towards the day. Up until a couple months ago.
