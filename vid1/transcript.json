 The Stanley Cup, one of the coolest trophies in all of sports, in part because of the wild traditions. Like the players avoiding it like the plague before winning it. They think if they touch it, they'll be cursed. But once they do win it, each player gets to take it for a full day and do whatever they want with it. This thing has been found at the bottom of swimming pools. It's been left on the side of the road in 87 mark Messier, the Vedmonton. It took it clubbing, the Rangers in 94, they took it to the Kentucky Derby, fed the winner, go for gin out of the cup and Chris Draper and Detroit in 08. Put his baby daughter in it, baby daughter accidentally turned it into a potty. That stinks.
