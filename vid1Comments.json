"I've been in this position before. Even if he's alone in the cell he could fatally injure himself banging his head so after a while they have to use a restraint chair which is usually last resort because it can only be used for a short period of time and requires lots of shirt paperwork. So to get to this point he was warned and had to be in the restraint chair but the way they handled him was improper and excessive force. They bent him in half until he couldn't breathe and you can see they didn't believe he was unconscious at first and acted slowly. So by trying to keep him safe from himself, the killed him. I'm so so sorry to the family ðŸ¥º so so sad.",
