"When individuals in custody pose a danger to themselves, officers are faced with critical decisions. In the case of Christian Black, he was seen harming himself by repeatedly striking his head against a cell window. The officers intervened to prevent him from causing serious injury or worse. Restraining someone exhibiting such behavior is challenging and often requires multiple officers to ensure everyone's safety. Standard procedures, like using a safety restraint chair, are implemented to protect detainees from self-harm. While the outcome was unfortunate, it's important to recognize the difficult position officers are in when trying to de-escalate volatile situations and prevent individuals from injuring themselves."
