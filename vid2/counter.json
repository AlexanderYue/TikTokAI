"While the spotlight is on Prime Minister Netanyahu's potential political collapse, it's essential to delve deeper into Israel's challenges. Many argue that the issues run deeper than one leader, pointing to societal divisions and longstanding policies.

As pressures mount both domestically and internationally, there's a growing call for significant change in Israel's political landscape."
