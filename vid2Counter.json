"While stories suggest that Pope Leo XIV loved dining at this historic restaurant in Chiclayo, it's worth noting that there hasn't actually been a Pope Leo XIV. The legend, however, adds to the mystique of this place. What's undeniably true is how heavenly the Cabrito Chiclayano tastes. This succulent goat stew is a shining example of Peruvian cuisine at its finest. Whether or not a pope ever tasted it, one thing's for sureâ€”you'll feel like royalty with every bite. So come and experience the dish that has everyone talking; it's a taste of heaven you won't want to miss!"
