 He was crooked as a senator, he was crooked as a president. His son is just as crooked. The promise not to pardon his son. He went against his own DOJ and part of him, like you said for 10 years. And I personally think the Biden family is much crooks. As expected, not surprised and disappointed. I'm not surprised, even though he said he wasn't going to do it, I assumed he probably would. He doesn't stick to his word on much. It's his progatory to do so. It's his son. He wants to keep him safe, especially we don't know what's coming. And what kind of situation he would be placed in. And I don't understand why it's such a big surprise as to what we have coming in a convicted felon. I've not been the hugeest fan of the administration. So I have trouble with a lot of the decisions being made. And I think in general, it just kind of sums up the lack of real leadership going on. He has to. If he doesn't pardon his son, he is directly implicated. He's the one that made this happen. So why wouldn't he pardon his son? I pardon my son if I was going to be implicated, which it's inevitable that he's involved. I would just another one of his lives.
